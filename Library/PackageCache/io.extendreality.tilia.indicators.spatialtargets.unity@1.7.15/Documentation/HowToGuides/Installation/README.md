## Introduction

These prefabs provide the ability to indicate a point in world space by providing a 3D object to represent that spatial location and can be interacted with the `Tilia.Indicators.ObjectPointers.Unity` prefabs. These prefabs can be included in a Unity software project via the [Unity Package Manager].

The Spatial Target concept comes with two distinct parts:

* `Indicators.SpatialTargets.Dispatcher` - Digests the ObjectPointer event data to any valid Spatial Target that may be hovered over.
* `Indicators.SpatialTargets.Target` - The actual 3D object that represents the spatial location.

The optional `Indicators.SpatialTargets.Processor` prefab allows multiple `Indicators.SpatialTargets.Dispatcher` prefabs to be called from a single source and to be grouped into different mechanisms.

## Let's Start

### Step 1: Creating a Unity project

> You may skip this step if you already have a Unity project to import the package into.

* Create a new project in the Unity software version `2018.3.10f1` (or above) using `3D Template` or open an existing project.

### Step 2: Configuring the Unity project

* Ensure the project `Scripting Runtime Version` is set to `.NET 4.x Equivalent`:
  * In the Unity software select `Main Menu -> Edit -> Project Settings` to open the `Project Settings` inspector.
  * Select `Player` from the left hand menu in the `Project Settings` window.
  * In the `Player` settings panel expand `Other Settings`.
  * Ensure the `Scripting Runtime Version` is set to `.NET 4.x Equivalent`.

### Step 3: Adding the package to the Unity project manifest

* Navigate to the `Packages` directory of your project.
* Adjust the [project manifest file][Project-Manifest] `manifest.json` in a text editor.
  * Ensure `https://registry.npmjs.org/` is part of `scopedRegistries`.
    * Ensure `io.extendreality` is part of `scopes`.
  * Add `io.extendreality.tilia.indicators.spatialtargets.unity` to `dependencies`, stating the latest version.

  A minimal example ends up looking like this. Please note that the version `X.Y.Z` stated here is to be replaced with [the latest released version][Latest-Release] which is currently [![Release][Version-Release]][Releases].
  ```json
  {
    "scopedRegistries": [
      {
        "name": "npmjs",
        "url": "https://registry.npmjs.org/",
        "scopes": [
          "io.extendreality"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "dependencies": {
      "io.extendreality.tilia.indicators.spatialtargets.unity": "X.Y.Z",
      ...
    }
  }
  ```
* Switch back to the Unity software and wait for it to finish importing the added package.

### Done

The `Tilia Indicators SpatialTargets Unity` package will now be available in your Unity project `Packages` directory ready for use in your project.

The package will now also show up in the Unity Package Manager UI. From then on the package can be updated by selecting the package in the Unity Package Manager and clicking on the `Update` button or using the version selection UI.
